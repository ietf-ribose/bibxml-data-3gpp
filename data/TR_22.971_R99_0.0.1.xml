    <abstract>This report describes a proposed framework for commercial and technical interworking between UMTS home environments and serving networks who have no direct prior commercial agreements with each other. 
This text is applicable to UMTS standardization within ETSI, and is produced with the intent to clarify the concepts involved, and identify those areas which require standardization.</abstract>
