    <abstract>This specification describes the Stage 1 description of HSCSD. HSCSD is a feature that allows users subscribing to the general bearer services to access user rates that can be achieved with one or more traffic channel. HSCSD also defines a flexible use of air interface resources, which makes efficient and flexible use of higher user rates feasible.</abstract>
