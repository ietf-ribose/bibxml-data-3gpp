    <abstract>This specification describes the Stage 1 description of the SAT primarily from the subscriber’s and serving environment’s points of view, and does not deal with the details of the human interface itself. It includes information applicable to network operators, serving environments and terminal, switch and database manufacturers and contains the core requirements for a SAT which are sufficient to provide a complete service.</abstract>
