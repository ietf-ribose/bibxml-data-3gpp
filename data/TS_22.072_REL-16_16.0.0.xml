    <abstract>CD enables the served mobile subscriber to respond to an incoming call offered by the network by requesting redirection of this call to another number specified in the response. The CD supplementary service can only be invoked before the connection is established by the served mobile subscriber, i.e. in response to the offered call, or during the period that the served subscriber is being informed of the call. The served subscriberâ€™s ability to originate calls is unaffected by the CD supplementary service.</abstract>
