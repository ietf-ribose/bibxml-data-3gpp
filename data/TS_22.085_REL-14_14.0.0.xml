    <abstract>The CUG supplementary service enables subscribers, connected to a network and possibly also other networks, to form CUGs to and from which access is restricted. A specific user may be a member of one or more CUGs. Members of a specific CUG can communicate among each other but not, in general, with users outside the group.</abstract>
