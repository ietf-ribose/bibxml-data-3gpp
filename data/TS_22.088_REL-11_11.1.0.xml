    <abstract>The call restriction supplementary services allow the possibility for a mobile subscriber to have barring of certain categories of outgoing or incoming calls at the mobile subscribers access.
The group of call restriction services includes two supplementary services:
–	barring of outgoing calls;
–	barring of incoming calls.
By use of subscription options, the mobile subscriber can at provision time select a set of one or more barring programs to determine the categories of calls to be barred. The following categories are defined:
–	all outgoing calls;
–	outgoing international calls;
–	outgoing international calls except those directed to the home PLMN country;
–	all incoming calls;
–	incoming calls when roaming outside the home PLMN country.</abstract>
