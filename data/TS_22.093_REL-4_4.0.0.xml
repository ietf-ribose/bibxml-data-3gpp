    <abstract>In the situation when subscriber A encounters a network determined user busy (NDUB) destination B, the subscriber A can request the CCBS supplementary service (i.e. activate a CCBS request against destination B). The network will then monitor the wanted destination B for becoming idle.
When the wanted destination B becomes idle, then the network will wait a short time in order to allow destination B to make an outgoing call. If destination B does not make any outgoing call within this time, then the network shall automatically recall subscriber A.</abstract>
