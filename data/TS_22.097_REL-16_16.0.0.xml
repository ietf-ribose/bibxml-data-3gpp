    <abstract>MSP is an optional service to enable mobile subscribers to have several profiles associated with a single subscriber identity (SIM) and a single international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), with each profile being a subscription option. Each profile may be used for mobile originated and mobile terminated calls. 
Up to four different profiles can be provisioned against a subscriber using the MSP feature. This will allow the subscriber to separate her telecommunication service needs into different identities (e.g. business and home).</abstract>
