    <abstract>This specification describes contains how the definition of the UMTS system will be achieved in a phased approach. This document also specifies the requirements for release 99 of UMTS. Some requirements which are necessary to ensure a smooth transition to later releases are also indicated. This document should, however, be read in conjunction with the other 22.000 series documents which provide a complete description of the requirements for UMTS release 1999 and beyond.</abstract>
