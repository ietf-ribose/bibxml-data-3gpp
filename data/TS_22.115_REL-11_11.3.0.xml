    <abstract>This specification describes the service aspects of charging and billing of the UMTS.
This standard is not intended to duplicate existing standards or standards being developed by other groups on these topics, and will reference these where appropriate. This standard will elaborate on the charging requirements described in the charging principles in TS 22.101 UMTS service principles. It will allow the generation of accurate charging information to be used in the commercial and contractual relationships between the parties concerned.</abstract>
