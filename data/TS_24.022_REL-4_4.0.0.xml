    <abstract>This specification describes the RLP for data transmission over the UMTS public land mobile network (PLMN). RLP covers the Layer 2 functionality of the ISO OSI reference model (IS 7498). It is based on ideas contained in IS 3309, IS 4335 and IS 7809 (HDLC of ISO) as well as ITU-T Recommendations X.25, Q.921 and Q.922 (LAP-B and LAP-D, respectively). RLP has been tailored to the special needs of digital radio transmission. RLP provides to its users the OSI data link service (IS 8886).</abstract>
