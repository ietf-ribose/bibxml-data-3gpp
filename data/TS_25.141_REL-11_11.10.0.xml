    <abstract>This specification describes the RF test methods and conformance requirements for UTRA base transceiver stations (BTS) operating in the FDD mode. These have been derived from, and are consistent with, the core UTRA specifications specified in the requirements reference subclause of each test. The maximum acceptable measurement uncertainty is specified in the TS for each test, where appropriate.</abstract>
