    <abstract>This specification describes the radio frequency (RF) test methods and conformance requirements for UTRA base transceiver stations (BTS) operating in the TDD mode. These have been derived from, and are consistent with, the core UTRA specifications specified in the requirements reference sub-clause of each test. The maximum acceptable measurement uncertainty is specified in the TS for each test, where appropriate.</abstract>
