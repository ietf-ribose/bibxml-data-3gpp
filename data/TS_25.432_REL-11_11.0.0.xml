    <abstract>This specification describes the signalling transport related to the Node B application part (NBAP) signalling to be used across the Iub interface. The Iub interface is a logical interface for the interconnection of Node B and RNC components of the UTRAN. The RNC signalling between these nodes is based on NBAP.</abstract>
