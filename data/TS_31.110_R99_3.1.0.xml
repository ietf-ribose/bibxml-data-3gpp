    <abstract>This document describes the numbering system for Application IDentifiers (AID) for 3G telecommunication Integrated Circuits (IC) card applications. The numbering system provides a means for an application and related services offered by a provider to identify if a given card contains the elements required by its application and related services.</abstract>
